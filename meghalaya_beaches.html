    <header>Beaches in Meghalaya?</header>
    <p>Unique to Meghalaya, these bridges are formed by training the roots of rubber trees to grow across rivers.</p>
    <p>Meghalaya is a landlocked state located in the hills of northeastern India. As such, it does not have any beaches.</p>
    <p>However, Meghalaya is famous for its natural beauty, including waterfalls, rivers, and natural swimming areas that offer similar relaxation experiences as beaches.</p>
    <h3>Dawki River</h3>
    <p>While not a beach, Dawkiâ€™s crystal-clear waters offer a unique boating experience that draws thousands of visitors every year.</p>
